# 0x08. Making Change

## Project Overview
For the “0. Change comes from within” project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.



In order to tackle this project, I had to revisit this concepts.

## Concepts Needed:

Greedy Algorithms:

Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.
Dynamic Programming:

Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.
Algorithmic Complexity:

Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.
Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.
Python Programming:

Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.
Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.

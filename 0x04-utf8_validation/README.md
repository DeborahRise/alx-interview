# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

## Concepts Needed:

* - Bitwise Operations in Python:
Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
Python Bitwise Operators

* - UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
UTF-8 Wikipedia
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets

* - Data Representation:
How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

* - List Manipulation in Python:
Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
Python Lists

* - Boolean Logic:
Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.

### The Task
Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

- Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
- Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
- A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
- The data set can contain multiple characters
- The data will be represented by a list of integers
- Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer

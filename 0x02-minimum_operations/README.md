# 0x02. Minimum Operations

for this project I had to relearn the following concepts

## 
## Concepts Needed:
### Dynamic Programming:

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

### Prime Factorization:

Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.

### Code Optimization:

Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
